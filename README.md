I am a master's student in ecology with a strong interest in **spatial ecology and landscape-scale analysis**, particularly **scale-dependent effects of landscape structure on ecological patterns and processes**.

My current focus is on using **R-based spatial analysis and statistical modeling** to study how environmental heterogeneity and human disturbance (e.g. urbanization) influence biodiversity and community structure.

This GitHub repository serves as a transparent record of my ongoing research projects, methodological exploration, literature synthesis, and research ideas.
